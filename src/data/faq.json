    "question": "How should I store my supplements?",
    "answer": "Most of our supplements should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep bottles tightly closed when not in use.

    "question": "Can I take multiple supplements together?",
    "answer": "In most cases, our supplements can be taken together safely. However, certain combinations may affect absorption or interact with each other. For example, calcium can interfere with iron absorption, so they should be taken at different times. We recommend consulting with a healthcare professional before starting a new supplement regimen, especially if you're taking multiple products or have health conditions."

    "question": "What is the best time of day to take supplements?",
    "answer": "The optimal timing varies by supplement type. Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and Omega-3s are best taken with meals containing healthy fats. B-vitamins and iron are best taken in the morning for energy support. Magnesium and calming herbs like Ashwagandha work well in the evening. Probiotics are typically most effective on an empty stomach. Specific timing recommendations are included on each product label."
